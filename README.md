# Cricket Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to provide comprehensive analysis of cricket data using various data manipulation and visualization techniques. The analysis covers multiple aspects of cricket performance and statistics.

## Data Processing Workflow
Data Collection: Excel files containing relevant cricket data were collected and consolidated into a single Excel file.

Data Preprocessing in Jupyter Notebook: Using Jupyter Notebook, the consolidated Excel file was read and processed. Important columns were extracted and converted into a JSON format for further manipulation.

JSON to Normal Columns Conversion: The JSON formatted data was transformed into multiple normal columns to facilitate easier analysis and visualization.

Export to Excel: The processed data was exported as an Excel file for further processing.

Data Transformation with Power Query: Power Query was used to transform the Excel file into a format suitable for visualization purposes.

Visualization in Power BI: The transformed data was imported into Power BI for creating insightful visualizations. Five different dashboard pages were prepared within Power BI to showcase various aspects of the cricket analysis.

## Project Structure
